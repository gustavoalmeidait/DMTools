# DMTools
resources for the Dungeon Master

I took the plunge and started DMing for my friends.
And got hooked, hooked I tell you!

After messing some notes while playing certain combats, trying to remember the NPCs' names(my kriptonite!) and my many shortcomings as DM, I decided to roll up my sleves and do something aobut it.

Feel free to take a peek and play with the code :-)
